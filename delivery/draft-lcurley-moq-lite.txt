                         Media over QUIC - Lite
                     draft-lcurley-moq-lite-latest

Abstract

   moq-lite is designed to fanout live content 1->N across the internet.
   It leverages QUIC to prioritize important content, avoiding head-of-
   line blocking while respecting encoding dependencies.  While
   primarily designed for media, the transport is payload agnostic and
   can be proxied by relays/CDNs without knowledge of codecs,
   containers, or encryption keys.

1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Rationale

   This draft is based on MoqTransport [moqt].  The concepts,
   motivations, and terminology are very similar and when in doubt,
   refer to existing MoqTransport literature.  A few things have been
   renamed (ex. object -> frame) to better align with media terminology.

   I absolutely believe in the motivation and potential of Media over
   QUIC.  The layering is phenomenal and addresses many of the problems
   with current live media protocols.  I fully support the goals of the
   working group and the IETF process.

   But it's been difficult to design such an experimental protocol via
   committee.  MoqTransport has become too complicated.

   There are too many messages, optional modes, and half-baked features.
   Too many hypotheses, too many potential use-cases, too many
   diametrically opposed opinions.  This is expected (and even desired)
   as compromise gives birth to a standard.

   But I believe the standardization process is hindering practical
   experimentation.  The ideas behind MoQ can be proven now before being
   cemented as an RFC.  We should spend more time building an _actual_
   application and less time arguing about a hypothetical one.

   moq-lite is the bare minimum needed for a real-time application
   aiming to replace WebRTC.  Every feature from MoqTransport that is
   not necessary (or has not been implemented yet) has been removed for
   simplicity.  This includes many great ideas (ex. group order) that
   may be added as they are needed.  This draft is the current state,
   not the end state.

3.  Concepts

   moq-lite consists of:

   *  *Session*: An established QUIC connection between a client and
      server.

   *  *Broadcast*: A collection of Tracks from a single publisher.

   *  *Track*: An series of Groups, each of which can be delivered and
      decoded _out-of-order_.

   *  *Group*: An series of Frames, each of which must be delivered and
      decoded _in-order_.

   *  *Frame*: A sized payload of bytes representing a single moment in
      time.

   The application determines how to split data into broadcast, tracks,
   groups, and frames.  The moq-lite layer provides fanout,
   prioritization, and caching even for latency sensitive applications.

3.1.  Session

   A Session consists of a connection between a client and a server.
   There is currently no P2P support within QUIC so it's out of scope
   for moq-lite.

   A session is established after the necessary QUIC, WebTransport, and
   moq-lite handshakes have completed.  The moq-lite handshake is simple
   and consists of version and extension negotiation.

   While moq-lite is a point-to-point protocol, it's intended to work
   end-to-end via relays.  Each client establishes a session with a CDN
   edge server, ideally the closest one.  Any broadcasts and
   subscriptions are transparently proxied by the CDN behind the scenes.

3.2.  Broadcast

   A Broadcast is a collection of Tracks from a single publisher.  This
   corresponds to a MoqTransport's "track namespace".

   A publisher may produce multiple broadcasts, each of which is
   advertised via an ANNOUNCE message.  The subscriber uses the
   ANNOUNCE_PLEASE message to discover available broadcasts.  These
   announcements are live and can change over time, allowing for dynamic
   origin discovery.

   A broadcast consists of any number of Tracks.  The contents,
   relationships, and encoding of tracks are determined by the
   application.

3.3.  Track

   A Track is a series of Groups identified by a unique name within a
   Broadcast.

   A track consists of a single active Group at any moment, called the
   "latest group".  When a new Group is started, the previous Group is
   closed and may be dropped for any reason.  The duration before an
   incomplete group is dropped is determined by the application and the
   publisher/subscriber's latency target.

   Every subscription is scoped to a single Track.  A subscription will
   always start at the latest Group and continues until either the
   publisher or subscriber cancels the subscription.

   The subscriber and publisher both indicate their delivery preference:
   - Priority indicates if Track A should be transmitted instead of
   Track B. - Ordered indicates if the Groups within a Track should be
   transmitted in order. - Max Latency indicates the maximum duration
   (based on instants) before a Group is abandoned.

   The combination of these preferences enables the most important
   content to arrive during network degradation while still respecting
   encoding dependencies.

3.4.  Group

   A Group is an ordered stream of Frames within a Track.

   Each group consists of an append-only list of Frames.  A Group is
   served by a dedicated QUIC stream which is closed on completion,
   reset by the publisher, or cancelled by the subscriber.  This ensures
   that all Frames within a Group arrive reliably and in order.

   In contrast, Groups may arrive out of order due to network congestion
   and prioritization.  The application MUST process or buffer groups
   out of order to avoid blocking on flow control.

3.5.  Frame

   A Frame is a payload of bytes within a Group.

   A frame is used to represent a chunk of data with an upfront size and
   Section 6.2.  The instant is relative to all other frames within the
   same Track, used for Section 6.3 and metrics.  The application MAY
   use the instant as a replacement for a presentation timestamp, used
   for track playback and synchronization.

4.  Flow

   This section outlines the flow of messages within a moq-lite session.
   See the section for Messages section for the specific encoding.

4.1.  Connection

   moq-lite runs on top of WebTransport.  WebTransport is a layer on top
   of QUIC and HTTP/3, required for web support.  The API is nearly
   identical to QUIC with the exception of stream IDs.

   How the WebTransport connection is authenticated is out-of-scope for
   this draft.

4.2.  Termination

   QUIC bidirectional streams have an independent send and receive
   direction.  Rather than deal with half-open states, moq-lite combines
   both sides.  If an endpoint closes the send direction of a stream,
   the peer MUST also close their send direction.

   moq-lite contains many long-lived transactions, such as subscriptions
   and announcements.  These are terminated when the underlying QUIC
   stream is terminated.

   To terminate a stream, an endpoint may: - close the send direction
   (STREAM with FIN) to gracefully terminate (all messages are flushed).
   - reset the send direction (RESET_STREAM) to immediately terminate.

   After resetting the send direction, an endpoint MAY close the recv
   direction (STOP_SENDING).  However, it is ultimately the other peer's
   responsibility to close their send direction.

4.3.  Handshake

   After a connection is established, the client opens a Session Stream
   and sends a SESSION_CLIENT message, to which the server replies with
   a SESSION_SERVER message.  The session is active until either
   endpoint closes or resets the Session Stream.

   This session handshake is used to negotiate the moq-lite version and
   any extensions.  See the Extension section for more information.

5.  Streams

   moq-lite uses a bidirectional stream for each transaction.  If the
   stream is closed, potentially with an error, the transaction is
   terminated.

5.1.  Bidirectional Streams

   Bidirectional streams are used for control streams.  There's a 1-byte
   STREAM_TYPE at the beginning of each stream.

                   +======+===============+============+
                   |   ID | Stream        | Creator    |
                   +======+===============+============+
                   |  0x0 | Session       | Client     |
                   +------+---------------+------------+
                   |  0x1 | Announce      | Subscriber |
                   +------+---------------+------------+
                   |  0x2 | Subscribe     | Subscriber |
                   +------+---------------+------------+
                   | 0x20 | SessionCompat | Client     |
                   +------+---------------+------------+

                                  Table 1

5.1.1.  Session

   The Session stream is used to establish the moq-lite session,
   negotiating the version and any extensions.  This stream remains open
   for the duration of the session and its closure indicates the session
   is closed.

   The client MUST open the Session Stream, write the Session Stream ID
   (0x0), and write a SESSION_CLIENT message.  If the server does not
   support any of the client's versions, it MUST close the stream with
   an error code and MAY close the connection.  Otherwise, the server
   replies with a SESSION_SERVER message to complete the handshake.

   Afterwards, both endpoints MAY send SESSION_UPDATE messages.  This is
   currently used to notify the other endpoint of a significant change
   in the session bitrate.

   This draft's version is combined with the constant 0xff0dad00.  For
   example, moq-lite-draft-04 is identified as 0xff0dad04.

5.1.2.  SessionCompat

   The SessionCompat stream exists to support moq-transport draft 11-14.
   This will be removed in a future version as moq-transport draft 15
   uses ALPN instead.

   The client writes a CLIENT_SETUP message on the SessionCompat stream
   and receives a SERVER_SETUP message in response.

   Consult the MoqTransport ([moqt]) draft for more information about
   the encoding.  Notably, each message contains a u16 length prefix
   instead of a VarInt (moq-lite).

   If a moq-lite version is negotiated, this stream becomes a normal
   Session stream.  If a moq-transport version is negotiated, this
   stream becomes the MoqTransport control stream.

5.1.3.  Announce

   A subscriber can open a Announce Stream to discover broadcasts
   matching a prefix.

   The subscriber creates the stream with a ANNOUNCE_PLEASE message.
   The publisher replies with an ANNOUNCE_INIT message containing all
   currently active broadcasts that currently match the prefix, followed
   by ANNOUNCE messages for any changes.

   The ANNOUNCE_INIT message contains an array of all currently active
   broadcast paths encoded as a suffix.  Each path in ANNOUNCE_INIT can
   be treated as if it were an ANNOUNCE message with status active.

   After ANNOUNCE_INIT, the publisher sends ANNOUNCE messages for any
   changes also encoded as a suffix.  Each ANNOUNCE message contains one
   of the following statuses:

   *  active: a matching broadcast is available.

   *  ended: a previously active broadcast is no longer available.

   Each broadcast starts as ended (unless included in ANNOUNCE_INIT) and
   MUST alternate between active and ended.  The subscriber MUST reset
   the stream if it receives a duplicate status, such as two active
   statuses in a row or an ended without active.  When the stream is
   closed, the subscriber MUST assume that all broadcasts are now ended.

   Path prefix matching and equality is done on a byte-by-byte basis.
   There MAY be multiple Announce Streams, potentially containing
   overlapping prefixes, that get their own ANNOUNCE_INIT and ANNOUNCE
   messages.

5.1.4.  Subscribe

   A subscriber opens Subscribe Streams to request a Track.

   The subscriber MUST start a Subscribe Stream with a SUBSCRIBE message
   followed by any number of SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE messages.  The publisher
   replies with any number of SUBSCRIBE_OK messages, or closes the
   stream.

   The publisher SHOULD close the stream after the track has ended.
   Either endpoint MAY reset/cancel the stream at any time.

6.  Delivery

   The most important concept in moq-lite is how to deliver a
   subscription.  QUIC can only improve the user experience if data is
   delivered out-of-order during congestion.  This is the sole reason
   why data is divided into Broadcasts, Tracks, Groups, and Frames.

   moq-lite consists of multiple groups being transmitted in parallel
   across separate streams.  How these streams get transmitted over the
   network is very important, and yet has been distilled down into a few
   simple properties:

6.1.  Prioritization

   The Publisher and Subscriber both exchange Priority and Ordered
   values: - Priority determines which Track should be transmitted next.
   - Ordered determines which Group within the Track should be
   transmitted next.

   A publisher SHOULD attempt to transmit streams based on these fields.
   This depends on the QUIC implementation and it may not be possible to
   get fine-grained control.

6.1.1.  Priority

   The Subscriber Priority is scoped to the connection.  The Publisher
   Priority SHOULD be used to resolve conflicts or ties.

   A conflict can occur when a relay tries to serve multiple downstream
   subscriptions from a single upstream subscription.  Any upstream
   subscription SHOULD use the publisher priority, not some combination
   of different subscriber priorities.

   Rather than try to explain everything, here's an example:

   *Example:* There are two people in a conference call, Ali and Bob.

   We subscribe to both of their audio tracks with priority 2 and video
   tracks with priority 1.  This will cause equal priority for Ali and
   Bob while prioritizing audio. ali/audio + bob/audio:
   subscriber_priority=2 publisher_priority=2 ali/video + bob/video:
   subscriber_priority=1 publisher_priority=1

   If Bob starts actively speaking, they can bump their publisher
   priority via a SUBSCRIBE_OK message.  This would cause tracks be
   delivered in this order: bob/audio: subscriber_priority=2
   publisher_priority=3 ali/audio: subscriber_priority=2
   publisher_priority=2 bob/video: subscriber_priority=1
   publisher_priority=2 ali/video: subscriber_priority=1
   publisher_priority=1

   The subscriber priority takes precedence, so we could override it if
   we decided to full screen Ali's window: ali/audio
   subscriber_priority=4 publisher_priority=2 ali/video
   subscriber_priority=3 publisher_priority=1 bob/audio
   subscriber_priority=2 publisher_priority=3 bob/video
   subscriber_priority=1 publisher_priority=2

6.1.2.  Ordered

   The Subscriber Ordered boolean signals if older (true) or newer
   (false) groups should be transmitted first within a Track.  The
   Publisher Ordered boolean MAY likewise be used to resolve conflicts.

   An application SHOULD use ordered when it wants to provide a VOD-like
   experience, preferring to buffer old groups rather than skip them.
   An application SHOULD NOT use ordered when it wants to provide a live
   experience, preferring to skip old groups rather than buffer them.

   Note that Section 6.3 is not affected by ordered.  An old group may
   still be cancelled/skipped if it's older than max_latency set by
   either peer.  An application MUST support gaps and out-of-order
   delivery even when ordered is true.

6.2.  Instant

   Every Frame consists of an Instant (in milliseconds) scoped to the
   track.

   This is used for Section 6.3 at the moq-lite layer.  The instant MAY
   be used for track synchronization at the application layer, however
   many containers/formats already contain their own timestamps.  A
   publisher SHOULD try to preserve the instant when the frame was first
   created/captured, proxying it.

   Each frame within a group MUST have a monotonically increasing
   instant.  If the presentation timestamp goes backwards (ex.
   b-frames), a frame's Instant SHOULD be the maximum presentation
   timestamp of the group up until that point.  Duplicates are allowed,
   encoded as delta 0.

   Unless specified by the application, a subscriber: - SHOULD NOT
   assume that an instant is a wall clock time. - SHOULD NOT assume that
   an instant starts at zero.

   Clock synchronization is out of scope for this draft.

6.3.  Expiration

   The Publisher and Subscriber both transmit a Max Latency value,
   indicating the maximum duration before a group is expired.

   It is not crucial to aggressively expire groups thanks to
   Section 6.1.  However, a lower priority group will still consume RAM,
   bandwidth, and potentially flow control.  It is RECOMMENDED that an
   application set conservative limits and only resort to expiration
   when data is absolutely no longer needed.

   A subscriber SHOULD expire groups based on the Subscriber Max Latency
   in SUBSCRIBE/SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE.  A publisher SHOULD expire groups
   based on the Publisher Max Latency in SUBSCRIBE_OK.  An
   implementation MAY use the minimum of both when determining when to
   expire a group.

   Each group consists of a maximum Frame Instant, the meaning of
   "processed" depending on the endpoint: - A publisher uses when a
   frame was queued, regardless of if it has been flushed to the QUIC
   layer. - A subscriber uses when a frame was received, regardless of
   if it has been flushed to the application.

   The entire track consists of a maximum Frame Instant using the same
   logic as above.  For each group, if the maximum Frame Instant is more
   than Max Latency behind the track's maximum Frame Instant, then the
   group is considered expired.  An expired group SHOULD BE reset at the
   QUIC level to avoid consuming flow control.

   *Example:* - Group 1: 1000 1500 (2000) - Group 2: 2500 3000

   In this example, frame 2000 has been queued by the publisher but not
   yet received by the subscriber (shown in parentheses).  If
   max_latency is 1250: - *Subscriber*: Track max is 3000, Group 1 max
   received is 1500.  Delta = 1500ms > 1250ms → SHOULD expire Group 1 -
   *Publisher*: Track max is 3000, Group 1 max queued is 2000.  Delta =
   1000ms < 1250ms → SHOULD NOT expire Group 1

   The opposite would be true if frame 3000 was still in transit:

   *Example:* - Group 1: 1000 1500 2000 - Group 2: 2500 (3000)

   *NOTE*: Individual frames within a group cannot be cancelled.  Even
   if max_latency was 0, Group 2 would not be expired until a (higher)
   frame in Group 3 is queued/received.

   An implementation MAY use the broadcast's maximum Frame Instant
   instead of the track's maximum Frame Instant.  This is useful to
   account for encoding delays, ex. when video takes 300ms longer to
   encode than audio.  However, it SHOULD NOT expire the highest
   sequence number group within each track, otherwise a track may become
   perpetually expired.

6.4.  Unidirectional Streams

   Unidirectional streams are used for data transmission.

                       +=====+========+===========+
                       |  ID | Stream | Creator   |
                       +=====+========+===========+
                       | 0x0 | Group  | Publisher |
                       +-----+--------+-----------+

                                 Table 2

6.4.1.  Group

   A publisher creates Group Streams in response to a Subscribe Stream.

   A Group Stream MUST start with a GROUP message and MAY be followed by
   any number of FRAME messages.  A Group MAY contain zero FRAME
   messages, potentially indicating a gap in the track.  A frame MAY
   contain an empty payload, potentially indicating a gap in the group.

   Both the publisher and subscriber MAY reset the stream at any time.
   This is not a fatal error and the session remains active.  The
   subscriber MAY cache the error and potentially retry later.

7.  Encoding

   This section covers the encoding of each message.

7.1.  Message Length

   Most messages are prefixed with a variable-length integer indicating
   the number of bytes in the message payload that follows.  This length
   field does not include the length of the varint length itself.

   An implementation SHOULD close the connection with a
   PROTOCOL_VIOLATION if it receives a message with an unexpected
   length.  The version and extensions should be used to support new
   fields, not the message length.

7.2.  STREAM_TYPE

   All streams start with a short header indicating the stream type.

   STREAM_TYPE {
     Stream Type (i)
   }

   The stream ID depends on if it's a bidirectional or unidirectional
   stream, as indicated in the Streams section.  A receiver MUST close
   the session if it receives an unknown stream type.

7.3.  SESSION_CLIENT

   The client initiates the session by sending a SESSION_CLIENT message.

   SESSION_CLIENT Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Supported Versions Count (i)
     Supported Version (i)
     Extension Count (i)
     [
       Extension ID (i)
       Extension Payload (b)
     ]...
   }

7.4.  SESSION_SERVER

   The server responds with the selected version and any extensions.

   SESSION_SERVER Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Selected Version (i)
     Extension Count (i)
     [
       Extension ID (i)
       Extension Payload (b)
     ]...
   }

7.5.  SESSION_UPDATE

   SESSION_UPDATE Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Session Bitrate (i)
   }

   *Session Bitrate*: The estimated bitrate of the QUIC connection in
   bits per second.  This SHOULD be sourced directly from the QUIC
   congestion controller.  A value of 0 indicates that this information
   is not available.

7.6.  ANNOUNCE_PLEASE

   A subscriber sends an ANNOUNCE_PLEASE message to indicate it wants to
   receive an ANNOUNCE message for any broadcasts with a path that
   starts with the requested prefix.

   ANNOUNCE_PLEASE Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Broadcast Path Prefix (s),
   }

   *Broadcast Path Prefix*: Indicate interest for any broadcasts with a
   path that starts with this prefix.

   The publisher MUST respond with an ANNOUNCE_INIT message containing
   any matching and active broadcasts, followed by ANNOUNCE messages for
   any updates.  Implementations SHOULD consider reasonable limits on
   the number of matching broadcasts to prevent resource exhaustion.

7.7.  ANNOUNCE_INIT

   A publisher sends an ANNOUNCE_INIT message immediately after
   receiving an ANNOUNCE_PLEASE to communicate all currently active
   broadcasts that match the requested prefix.  Only the suffixes are
   encoded on the wire, as the full path can be constructed by
   prepending the requested prefix.

   This message is useful to avoid race conditions, as ANNOUNCE_INIT
   does not trickle in like ANNOUNCE messages.  For example, an API
   server that wants to list the current participants could issue an
   ANNOUNCE_PLEASE and immediately return the ANNOUNCE_INIT response.
   Without ANNOUNCE_INIT, the API server would have use a timer to wait
   until ANNOUNCE to guess when all ANNOUNCE messages have been
   received.

   ANNOUNCE_INIT Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Suffix Count (i),
     [
       Broadcast Path Suffix (s),
     ]...
   }

   *Suffix Count*: The number of active broadcast path suffixes that
   follow.  This can be 0.  A publisher MUST NOT include duplicate
   suffixes in a single ANNOUNCE_INIT message.

   *Broadcast Path Suffix*: Each suffix is combined with the broadcast
   path prefix from ANNOUNCE_PLEASE to form the full broadcast path.
   This includes all currently active broadcasts matching the prefix.

7.8.  ANNOUNCE

   A publisher sends an ANNOUNCE message to advertise a change in
   broadcast availability.  Only the suffix is encoded on the wire, as
   the full path can be constructed by prepending the requested prefix.

   The status is relative to the ANNOUNCE_INIT and all prior ANNOUNCE
   messages combined.  A client MUST ONLY alternate between status
   values (from active to ended or vice versa).

   ANNOUNCE Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Announce Status (i),
     Broadcast Path Suffix (s),
   }

   *Announce Status*: A flag indicating the announce status.

   *  ended (0): A path is no longer available.

   *  active (1): A path is now available.

   *Broadcast Path Suffix*: This is combined with the broadcast path
   prefix to form the full broadcast path.

7.9.  SUBSCRIBE

   SUBSCRIBE is sent by a subscriber to start a subscription.

   SUBSCRIBE Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Subscribe ID (i)
     Broadcast Path (s)
     Track Name (s)
     Subscriber Priority (8)
     Subscriber Ordered (1)
     Subscriber Max Latency (i)
   }

   *Subscribe ID*: A unique identifier chosen by the subscriber.  A
   Subscribe ID MUST NOT be reused within the same session, even if the
   prior subscription has been closed.

   *Subscriber Priority*: The priority of the subscription within the
   session, represented as a u8.  The publisher SHOULD transmit _higher_
   values first during congestion.  See the Section 6.1 section for more
   information.

   *Subscriber Ordered*: A boolean representing whether groups are
   transmitted in ascending (true) or descending (false) order.  The
   publisher SHOULD transmit _older_ groups first during congestion if
   true.  See the Section 6.1 section for more information.

   *Subscriber Max Latency*: This value is encoded in milliseconds and
   represents the maximum age of a group.  The publisher SHOULD reset
   old group streams when the last processed frame is at least this much
   older than the newest frame.  See the Section 6.3 section for more
   information.

7.10.  SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE

   A subscriber can modify a subscription with a SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE
   message.  A subscriber MAY send multiple SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE messages to
   update the subscription.

   SUBSCRIBE_UPDATE Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Subscriber Priority (8)
     Subscriber Ordered (1)
     Subscriber Max Latency (i)
   }

   See Section 5.1.4 for information about each field.

7.11.  SUBSCRIBE_OK

   A SUBSCRIBE_OK message is sent in response to a SUBSCRIBE.  The
   publisher MAY send multiple SUBSCRIBE_OK messages to update the
   subscription.

   SUBSCRIBE_OK Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Publisher Priority (8)
     Publisher Ordered (1)
     Publisher Max Latency (i)
   }

   See Section 5.1.4 for information about each field.

7.12.  GROUP

   The GROUP message contains information about a Group, as well as a
   reference to the subscription being served.

   GROUP Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Subscribe ID (i)
     Group Sequence (i)
   }

   *Subscribe ID*: The corresponding Subscribe ID.  This ID is used to
   distinguish between multiple subscriptions for the same track.

   *Group Sequence*: The sequence number of the group.  This SHOULD
   increase by 1 for each new group.  A subscriber MUST handle gaps,
   potentially caused by congestion.

7.13.  FRAME

   The FRAME message is a payload at a specific point of time.

   FRAME Message {
     Message Length (i)
     Instant Delta (i)
     Payload (b)
   }

   *Instant Delta*: The instant when the frame was created, in
   milliseconds, scoped to the track.  This is encoded as a delta from
   the previous frame in the same group.  An application SHOULD use the
   capture/presentation time to account for any encoding delays.  See
   the Section 6.2 section for more information.

   *Payload*: An application specific payload.  A generic library or
   relay MUST NOT inspect or modify the contents unless otherwise
   negotiated.
